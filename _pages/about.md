I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park, advised by [Prof. Dinesh Manocha](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/dmanocha) at the GAMMA Lab.

My research focuses on grounding language models through retrieval, attribution, and reasoning, with an emphasis on semi-structured and multimodal data such as documents, tables, and charts. I am particularly interested in how context can be constructed and used effectively in generation, decision-making, and task-oriented agents.

Previously, I worked on greenwashing detection as a **Data Science for Social Good Fellow** at the University of Warwick, collaborating with the [Algorithmic Transparency Institute](https://ati.io/), [Dr. Geoffrey Supran](https://people.miami.edu/profile/19dbd62ef7e2e5fcd155ef0c53f35bc8), and [Dr. John Cook](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/1028119-john-cook). I also contributed to fact annotation and document retrieval systems at [Scalenut](https://www.scalenut.com/).
