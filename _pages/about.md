I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park, advised by [Prof. Dinesh Manocha](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/dmanocha) at the GAMMA Lab.

My research interests span LLM-based agents across a range of applications, including document and multimodal understanding, code and software engineering workflows, and general-purpose API-driven agents. More broadly, I work on grounding language models through retrieval, attribution, and structured reasoning, with a focus on how context is constructed, selected, and used effectively in generation, decision-making, and complex task execution.

Previously, I worked on greenwashing detection as a Data Science for Social Good Fellow at the University of Warwick, collaborating with the [Algorithmic Transparency Institute](https://ati.io/). I also contributed to fact attribution and document retrieval systems at [Scalenut](https://www.scalenut.com/). Last summer, I interned as an Applied Science Intern at  [Amazon](https://kiro.dev/), working on software engineering agents. 

This summer, I will be joining [Meta Superintelligence Labs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_Superintelligence_Labs) as a research intern in Menlo Park — looking forward to connecting with people in the Bay Area!
